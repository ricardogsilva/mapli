//! Thread-safe pool of workers for rendering map tiles.
//!
//! This module implements a thread-safe pool of workers for rendering map images
//! and tiles. The `RenderPool` struct is `Send+Sync` and can be shared between
//! threads. It manages a set of worker threads that can render map images and
//! tiles concurrently.
//! The pool also maintains a registry of styles that can be used by the workers to
//! render the images.
//! All MapLibre state lives in the worker threads, so the pool is just a thin wrapper around them.
