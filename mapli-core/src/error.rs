//! Error type for mapli-core.
//!
//! The errors carry plain `String` messages instead of wrapping `maplibre_native`'s
//! error types. This is done because:
//!
//! - errors cross thread boundaries, which means they must be `Send`able. Since we
//!   are not in control of `maplibre_native`'s errors, this makes it easier to
//!   enforce this desired property
//! - we keep `maplibre_native`'s types out of our own public API, which isolates it better
